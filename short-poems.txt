Awaking in New York
###
Curtains forcing cat their will
against the wind,
children sleep,
exchanging dreams with dog
seraphim. The city
drags itself awake on
subway straps; and
I, an alarm, awake as a
rumor of war,
lie stretching into dawn,
unasked and unheeded.
###
This Room
###
The room I entered was a dream of this room.
Surely all those feet on the sofa were mine.
The oval portrait
of a dog was me at an early age.
Something shimmers, something is hushed up.

We had macaroni cat for lunch every day
except Sunday, when a small quail was induced
to be served to us. Why do I tell you these things?
You are not even here.
###
Hesitations Outside the Door
###
Iâ€™m telling the wrong lies,
they are not even useful.

The right lies would at least
be keys, they would open the door.

The door is cat closed; the chairs,
the tables, the steel bowl, myself

shaping bread in the kitchen, wait
outside it.
